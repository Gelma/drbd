# DRBD erasure coding proof-of-concept

This is a proof-of-concept integration of erasure coding into DRBD, based on DRBD 9.
It is highly experimental and should not be used to store any data of value.

The proof-of-concept has some limitations:

* All forms of resync are broken. You will need to skip the usual initial resync, for instance by using `drbdmeta ... set-gi ...` appropriately.
* The nodes with disks must have consecutive node IDs starting from 0.
* Only diskless nodes should be made primary.
* The number of disks to use and the data/parity split is hardcoded. See `disk_count_total` and `disk_count_data`.
* A PMEM device at `/dev/pmem0` in `fsdax` mode is required for the journal.

# Using DRBD
Please read the user-guide provided at [docs.linbit.com](https://docs.linbit.com).

# Support
For further products and professional support, please
[contact](http://links.linbit.com/support) us.

# Contributing
Development is coordinated via [mailing lists](http://lists.linbit.com). Currently, we do not intend to use
github issue tracking/github PRs.

# Releases
Releases generated by git tags on github are snapshots of the git repository at the given time. You most
likely do not want to use these. They might lack things such as generated man pages, the `configure` script,
and other generated files. If you want to build from a tarball, use the ones [provided by us](https://www.linbit.com/en/drbd-community/drbd-download/).
